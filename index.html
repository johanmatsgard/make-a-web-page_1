    <h3 class="stage">STAGE ZERO: THE BASICS OF THE WEB AND HTML</h3>
  </div>

  <div class="note">
    <h4>How the Web Works</h4>
    <p>This may be a bit too basic, but ... The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other. When a person goes to a web page like www.google.com, their computer sends a <em>HTTP Request</em> to a <em>server</em>. The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer where a <em>web browser</em> interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="note">
    <h4>HTML</h4>
    <P>HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em> HTML documents form the majority of the content on the web. HTML documents contain <em>text content</em> which describes "what you see" and <em>markup</em> which describes "how it looks".</p>
  </div>

  <div class="note">
    <h4>Tags and Elements</h4>
    <p>HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML <b>tags</b>.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="note">
    <h4>Why Computers are Stupid</h4>
    <p>Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="note">
    <h4>Inline vs Block Elements</h4>
    <p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="one" class="title"><h3 class="stage">STAGE ONE: ADDING CSS AND HTML STRUCTURE</h3></div>

  <div class="note">
    <h4>What is CSS?</h4>
    <p>CSS is code written to control the "style" of HTML elements.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="note">
    <h4>Link to your stylesheet</h4>
    <p>In the header, make sure you link to the css style sheet properly to be able to apply all of your layout and styles!</p>
  </div>

    <div class="note">
    <h4>Why use Class?</h4>
    <p>Use this attribute to be able to apply the same style to several elements that will share the same style instead of doing each one individually.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="note">
    <h4>When to use ID</h4>
    <p>Use this attribute to create anchor links within a page or when something needs to be very specific, and won't want to share the same styles.</p>
  </div>

    <div class="note">
    <h4>Avoiding repitition</h4>
    <p>Avoiding repetition is imperitive to a programmer. As mentioned in the above notes, using classes and tags correctly saves you a lot of effort in the long run. It might not seem like much on a page like this, but the more you scale the more time you alleviate having to go back on a case by case basis and instead can just change one line in the css to make the changes across all your work. Not working this way can lead to unncessary errors and make troubleshooting and finding the errors much more work than actually needed. Another reason for working this way is to make the website to be more consistant with its styling.</p>
